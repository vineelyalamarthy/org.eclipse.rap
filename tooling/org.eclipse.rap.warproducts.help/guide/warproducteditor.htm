<h1>WAR Product Configuration Editor</h1>
<p>Building an WAR product using PDE is centered around a WAR product 
configuration, a <em>.warproduct</em> file. This file manages all aspects of a 
WAR product definition from its constituent plug-ins to configuration files.</p>
<p>The WAR product configuration is entirely managed by PDE to simplify WAR 
the war deployment process. Its format is internal and is not intended to be read by 
tools other than PDE.</p>
<p>PDE provides a form-based multi-page editor to manage the WAR product 
configuration.</p>
<p>For details on the <strong>WAR Product Configuation Editor</strong>, refer to 
the following documents:</p>
