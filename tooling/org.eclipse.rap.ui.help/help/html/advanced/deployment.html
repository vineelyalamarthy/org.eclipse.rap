  <h1>How to Deploy a RAP Application to a Servlet Container?</h1> 
  
  <p>The current eclipse build tools and wizards do not directly support 
  building this style of application so for the time being the build can be
  performed with a series of Ant scripts and resource templates. The 
  <code>org.eclipse.rap.demo.feature</code> shows how to create a <code>WAR</code> that
  contains the <code>org.eclipse.rap.demo</code> project as RAP application.</p>
  
  <p>Note: As with RCP applications there are a wide variety of possible
  configurations. What's given in <code>org.eclipse.rap.demo.feature</code> is
  just one possibility.</p>
  
  <p>As prerequisites we assume that you are familiar with the bundles- and 
  build information section of the 
  <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/equinox/server/http_in_container.php">
  Equinox in a Servlet Container</a> document. We also assume that you checked
  out the 
  <a href="servletbridge-anon.psf">servlet bridge and demo feature bundles</a>
  in your workspace. The link points to a 'team project set' file. 
  In case you haven't done that so far, use <b>File</b> 
  &gt; <b>Import</b> &gt; <b>Team Project Set</b> and enter the location of
  the downloaded file. Press <b>Finish</b> and the necessary 
  projects will be imported from CVS.</p>
  
  <h3>Prepare the build script</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Open the <code>script/webappBuilder.xml</code> of the
  <code>org.eclipse.rap.demo.feature</code> with the Ant editor.</li>
  <li>Adjust the <code>servletbridge.dir</code> property
  (see docu in script file).</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="../../images/script.png">
  
  <h3>Create the build content</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Right-Click on the <code>webAppBuilder.xml</code> script in the IDE and 
      "Run Ant". (Note: In order to make the <code>pde.exportFeatures</code> task
      available in the IDE select "Run in the same JRE as the workspace" on the
      JRE tab from "Run Ant...").</li>
  <li>The actual build (i.e. the <code>pde.exportFeatures</code> task) is run 
      asynchronously. This means you need to wait a little more after the Ant 
      script finished.
      Watch the progress monitor in the status bar to detrmine when the build 
      is done.</li>
  <li>Refresh the feature project - a build folder should appear. (Note:
      The <code>pde.exportFeatures</code> target will build the plug-ins
      asynchronously and may take a while till finished. After that the complete 
      <code>WAR</code> content should be available in the build folder.</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="../../images/build.png">
  
  <h3>Adjust the <code>config.ini</code></h3>
  <p>The <code>osgi.bundles</code> property from the <code>config.ini</code> 
    tells Equinox, the OSGi framework, which plug-ins there are in the system. 
    The sole fact that a plug-in is located in the right folder (i.e. 
    <code>eclipse/plugins</code>) doesn't make it known to the running OSGi 
    framework.
    <br />
    For futher information on the <code>config.ini</code> and related 
    configuration options, please read the
    <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/runtime-options.html">
    Eclipse Runtime Options</a> chapter.
    The latest version can also be viewed from within the IDE. From the menu, 
    chose Help &gt; Help Contents. In the upcoming help window, chose
    Platform Plugin Developer Guide &gt; Other Reference Information &gt;
    Runtime Options
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Adjust the path to the plug-in directory of your build in the
      <code>ConfigIniCreator</code> (see the comment in the 
      <code>ConfigIniCreator</code> class).</li>
    <li>Run the ConfigIniCreator as Java application.</li>
    <li>Manually verify the output. 
      The ConfigIniCreator uses a very rough estimation to tell the 
      bundle id (its <code>Bundle-Symbolic-Name</code>) from the file name.
      Therefore it may generate errornous content.
    </li>
    <li>Copy the console output to the <code>config.ini</code> file of your
      build.</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="../../images/config.png">
  
  
  <p>After that, pack the <code>WAR</code> of the application build available in the 
  build folder (in our case the content of <code>build/rapdemo</code>). Deploy
  the <code>WAR</code> to a servlet container to see whether the build was successful :-)</p>

  templates directory for more infos on how activating the console)
  
  <h2>How to deploy my own application?</h2>
  
  <p>To deploy your own application like described above you will have
  to create your own feature. The feature should contain the same plug-in 
  references as the demo feature (except the demo-plug-in of course!) plus the
  plug-ins that make up your application. It is important that your plug-ins
  reference the Servlet API by using the <code>Import-Package</code> directive
  instead of the <code>Require-Bundle</code> directive. See the 
  <code>MANIFEST.MF</code> of the demo project for an example.</p>
  
  <p>Copy the script and templates folder to the feature and modifiy them
  according to your project structure. Following the steps above should lead
  to a fully functional <code>WAR</code> of your application.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: If you encounter problems during the build, you
  may consider to use the PDE-Export (available from the feature editor)
  before exporting the whole WAR at once. This proved helpful for
  trouble-shooting as the export may show problem-relevant dialogs that are
  suppressed in the Ant export.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Note also</strong>: Besides the application server log files
  there also exists an Equinox framework log that can be found under the webapp's
  work directory, e.g. on Tomcat:
  <pre>
  <code>&lt;tomcat-installation&gt;/work/Catalina/localhost/demo/eclipse/workspace/.metadata/.log</code>
  </pre>
  In case Equinox isn't able to start at all, you may also look for log files 
  at:
  <pre>
  <code>&lt;tomcat-installation&gt;/work/Catalina/localhost/demo/eclipse/configuration</code>
  </pre>

  </p>

  <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
  You can use the following checklist to find errors when your exported application
  does not work:

  <ul>
    <li>Check your <code>build.properties</code> file
      <ul>
        <li>Are you exporting the <code>plugin.xml</code>?</li>
        <li>If you are using <code>plugin.properties</code> files, make sure 
          they are exported.</li>
        <li>Are all libraries you are using listed on the plug-ins class path?</li> 
        <li>Tip: As PDE build sometimes swallows error messages try exporting
          your feature with <em>Deployable Feature</em> export, this may turn up
          error messages.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Enable the OSGi console by adding this init-param to the <code>web.xml</code>:
      <pre>&lt;init-param&gt;
  &lt;param-name&gt;commandline&lt;/param-name&gt;
  &lt;param-value&gt;-console&lt;/param-value&gt; 
&lt;/init-param&gt;</pre>
      <ul>
        <li>You can add a port after <code>-console</code> and then telnet to
          the OSGi console: <code>telnet localhost &lt;port&gt;</code>.</li>
        <li>Type <code>ss</code> in the console and see if all bundles are 
          started. If not try starting them with
          <code>start &lt;bundle-id&gt;</code>.
          The stack traces may hint to what is missing.</li>
        <li>Make sure that there is a 
        <code>org.eclipse.equinox.servletbridge.extensionbundle</code> in 
        the <code>ss</code>-listing who's state is <code>RESOVLED</code>.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Make sure that the WAR does <b>not</b> contain the
      <code>javax.servlet</code> bundle.
      In the plug-in maniferst the <code>javax.servlet</code> <b>must</b> be
      listed in the <code>Import-Package</code> section, not in
      <code>Require-Bundle</code>.</li>
    <li>Make sure that the WAR does <b>not</b> contain the
      <code>org.eclipse.update.configurator</code> bundle.</li>
    <li>Does the WAR contain compile errors?
      If so, you will probably find a zip archive somewhere in your output
      folder. It contains log files with the compiler output.</li>
    <li>Start with a working example:
      Download
      <a href="http://rap.eclipsesource.com/download/rapdemo.war">rapdemo.war</a>
      and integrate your plug-ins.</li>
    <li>Use the product export to validate your feature:
      <ul>
        <li>Create a product configuration with an arbitrary
        name (<em>File &gt; New &gt; Other &gt; Product Configuration</em>).</li>
        <li>Select <q>The product configuration is based on <em>features</em></q>
        on the <em>Overview</em> page.</li>
        <li>Add your feature to the list of features on the <em>Dependencies</em>
          page.
        </li>
        <li>Press the <em>Validate</em> button in the top-left corner of the editor.
          Ignore complaints about missing <code>javax.servlet</code> packages.
          Be aware that unresolved optional dependencies aren't reported as errors.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>If you are re-deploying, make sure to delete the work directory of your 
      servlet engine (e.g.
      <code>&lt;tomcat_install&gt;/work/Catalina/localhost/&lt;webapp_name&gt;</code>
      in Tomcat).</li>
  </ul>
